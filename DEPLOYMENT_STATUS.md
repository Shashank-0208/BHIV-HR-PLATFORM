## 🚨 Known Issues & Status

### **1. Agent Service Offline (High Priority)**
- **Issue**: Heavy ML dependencies causing deployment failures
- **Root Cause**: torch (~755MB) + transformers exceed free tier memory
- **Impact**: AI matching uses database fallback algorithm
- **Workaround**: Gateway provides robust fallback matching
- **Status**: Investigating lighter ML models or paid tier upgrade

### **2. Authentication Middleware Order (Low Priority)**
- **Issue**: Rate limiting returns 403 instead of 401 for invalid auth
- **Impact**: Slightly confusing error messages
- **Status**: Identified, non-critical (authentication still works)

### **3. Schema Verification Endpoint (Enhancement)**
- **Issue**: New endpoint not yet deployed to production
- **Impact**: Cannot directly verify production schema
- **Status**: Ready for deployment, pending next update
