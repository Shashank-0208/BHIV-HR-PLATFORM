Shashank Mishra — 7-Day AI Automation & Integration
Sprint
Objective:
Transform the BHIV-HR-Platform into a fully AI-driven, N8N-integrated, automation-ready system
connecting all three portals (Client, HR, Candidate) with real-world communication flows.
Sprint Outcomes
By the end of this 7-day sprint:
Candidate, HR, and Client portals are connected via APIs
AI agents (from BHIV Core) respond dynamically to candidate & recruiter actions
N8N automations handle WhatsApp, Email, Telegram, and (Vaani–Karthikeya) voice interactions
The platform can onboard → manage → offboard candidates with automated notifications and
updates
Candidate-facing UI functional (in collaboration with Nikhil’s frontend design)
Task Breakdown
Day 1–2: Candidate Portal Build + Backend Integration
• Create Candidate Portal APIs:
◦ /candidate/register, /candidate/login
◦ /candidate/profile (CRUD: education, experience, certificates, skills)
◦ /candidate/applications (view applied jobs, status, tasks)
• Integrate Job Listings API (from HR portal)
• Connect to BHIV Core (Nisarg) for AI-based JD recommendations
• Save candidate actions/events to BHIV Bucket (Nipun)
Deliverable: Candidate portal backend ready + connected with HR and Client modules.
Day 3: Communication Layer Integration (N8N Setup)
• Deploy N8N workflows for:
◦ Email notifications (job updates, task assignments)
◦ WhatsApp updates (via Twilio / Meta API)
◦ Telegram bot (status inquiries, interview reminders)
• Trigger automation events via API hooks:
◦ When HR shortlists → WhatsApp/Email sent
◦ When Client schedules → Telegram/Email sent
◦ When Candidate submits feedback → HR notified
Deliverable: Working N8N instance with sample flow automations and webhook triggers from
backend.
Day 4–5: AI Voice & Feedback Integration (Vaani + Karthikeya)
• Integrate Vaani (STT) and Karthikeya (TTS) modules:
◦ Voice-based candidate interaction (e.g., “Confirm interview time”, “Provide
feedback”)
◦ Voice-to-text conversion → routed to BHIV Core for interpretation
• Create feedback loop:
Candidate/HR voice feedback → sentiment → reward (to Ishan’s RL loop)
• Add audit logs for each voice interaction (timestamp, transcript, sentiment result)
Deliverable: Working voice-based interaction pipeline between candidate ↔ HR using Vaani/
Karthikeya.
Day 6: Cross-Portal AI Agent Synchronization
• Align agent events between portals:
◦ When HR updates status → Client dashboard auto-refreshes
◦ Candidate confirmation updates recruiter feed
◦ RL feedback updates BHIV Core policy state
• Build agent-state synchronizer service (Node/Python microservice)
• Ensure real-time updates (Socket.IO or polling) across dashboards
Deliverable: Seamless 3-way data sync with AI agents handling background reasoning.
Day 7: Testing, Demo Prep & Documentation
• Conduct end-to-end testing:
◦ Candidate applies → HR shortlists → Client schedules → Candidate feedback → RL
updates
• Record automation demo (showing N8N triggers, AI voice, and dashboard sync)
• Write README.md covering:
◦ APIs
◦ N8N setup guide
◦ Automation logic
◦ Voice module usage
◦ Integration architecture diagram
Deliverable: Fully documented, demo-ready AI-powered HR Platform.
Integration Alignment (No Overlap)
Tech Stack Notes
• Backend: Node.js + Express + MongoDB (or Supabase)
• Automation: N8N (email, WhatsApp, Telegram, triggers)
• Voice: Vaani (STT) + Karthikeya (TTS)
• AI Integration: Python (Flask or FastAPI microservice from BHIV Core)
• Comms Layer: Socket.IO for live updates
• Frontend (with Nikhil): React/Next.js for UI implementation
Goal
Upgrade the BHIV HR Platform into a self-learning, AI-automated system using:
Module Owner Responsibility
Core Backend +
Automation Shashank APIs, N8N, voice, sync
RL + Feedback Agent Ishan RL loop + reward learning
BHIV Core Nisarg Agent reasoning, MCP
integration
BHIV Bucket Nipun Persistent data storage
Frontend Nikhil/
Yash UI/UX of all portals
• Reinforcement Learning (RL) → adaptive match scoring
• N8N automation → email, WhatsApp, Telegram workflows
• MCPs (Model Context Protocols) → real-time AI decision integration
• Voice layer (STT/TTS) → for recruiter-candidate interactions
