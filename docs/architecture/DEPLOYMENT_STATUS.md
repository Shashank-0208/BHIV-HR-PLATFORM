## 🚨 Known Issues & Status

### **1. Agent Service Event Loop (RESOLVED)**
- **Issue**: Batch matching failing with event loop conflicts
- **Root Cause**: Async functions without proper async operations
- **Solution**: Removed async from endpoints causing conflicts
- **Impact**: All Agent service endpoints now functional
- **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - Service fully operational

### **2. Authentication Middleware Order (Low Priority)**
- **Issue**: Rate limiting returns 403 instead of 401 for invalid auth
- **Impact**: Slightly confusing error messages
- **Status**: Identified, non-critical (authentication still works)

### **3. Schema Verification Endpoint (Enhancement)**
- **Issue**: New endpoint not yet deployed to production
- **Impact**: Cannot directly verify production schema
- **Status**: Ready for deployment, pending next update
