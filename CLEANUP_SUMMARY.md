  - Supports all 53 API endpoints (48 Gateway + 5 Agent)
  - Includes all missing columns identified in assessment
  - 25+ performance indexes
  - Enterprise security features (2FA, audit logging, rate limiting)
  - Sample data for testing

### 🗑️ Redundant Files Removed
The following database files were successfully removed as they are now consolidated:

1. **`services/db/complete_schema_with_fixes.sql`** ❌ REMOVED
2. **`services/db/init_complete.sql`** ❌ REMOVED  
3. **`services/db/production_schema_complete.sql`** ❌ REMOVED
